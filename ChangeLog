	* release 0.0.8
	* fixed bug which prevented mmap mode working in genstream
	* added --seek option to genstream and checkstream
	* specifying no -T option gives an extra 8 bits of file
	  offset, allowing checking files larger than 1TiB
	* use valloc() to page align write() buffer for direct IO
	* remove duplicate perror() when write() fails

Mon Nov 22 20:21:00 2004  Greg Banks <gnb@melbourne.sgi.com>
	* release 0.0.7
	* more work based on a patch from Dave Chinner
	* added --version option to print version
	* count number of bytes and blocks read/written and emit in stats
	* added stream_flush() to ensure last partial block write is counted
	* emit some stats always (regardless of loop_mode)
	* emit stats about number of errors only when errors have occurred
	* handle both SIGINT and SIGTERM in both genstream & checkstream

Wed Nov 17 21:08:00 2004  Greg Banks <gnb@melbourne.sgi.com>
	* release 0.0.6
	* checkstream no longer silently accepts files shorter than 7 bytes
	* checkstream complains about files which have unaligned lengths
	* added -e option to checkstream, stops on first error
	* added -T option to generate and check an 8 bit tag in each
	  record, to detect inter-file corruption bugs.
